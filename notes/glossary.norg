** Physics Concepts
*** Newtonian Gravity
    - A classical model describing the attractive force between two masses.
    - F = G * (m₁ * m₂) / r²

*** Kinetic Energy (KE)
    - Energy of motion.
    - KE = ½ * m * v²

*** Potential Energy (PE)
    - Energy due to position in a gravitational field.
    - PE = -G * (m₁ * m₂) / r

*** Softening Factor
    - Small constant added to avoid division by zero when distance ≈ 0.
    - Stabilizes force calculation at close range.

*** Elastic Collision
    - Momentum-conserving bounce between particles.

*** Unit Vector (r̂)
    - Direction vector of length 1.
    - Used to normalize a displacement vector.

** Code Architecture
*** Entity
    - Core simulation entity with mass, position, velocity, acceleration, etc.

*** GravitySystem
    - Calculates and applies gravitational force between particles.

*** Integration
    - Advances the state of particles using current and predicted acceleration.

*** Vec2
    - 2D vector utility struct with x and y.

** Simulation Control
*** Time Step (dt)
    - Fixed duration between simulation updates.
    - Smaller dt → higher accuracy, slower runtime.

*** Initial Scale
    - Zoom level at which the simulation is rendered.

*** Trail
    - Deque of previous positions used to visualize particle paths.

*** Static Body
    - An immovable object (e.g. sun) not affected by forces.

** Constants in Use
*** GRAVITY_CONSTANT
    - G = 6.6743
    - Scaled down from real-world G for stability.

*** DT
    - dt = 0.00694444 / 4.0
    - Controls simulation update rate.

*** SOFTENING
    - Prevents infinite forces during close encounters.
