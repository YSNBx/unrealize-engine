* 2025-06-22 - Newtonian Gravity

** summaru
	 - refined newtonian gravity
	 - added verlet integration for higher simulation accuracy
	 -- fixes drift as well
	 - tuning constants::DT to 0.0069444 (1/144) / 4.0 - stable orbit
	 - fixed window area clipping, whole window is used now

** observations
	 - need to use predicted positions (particles_next) with correct acceleration logic
	 - cloning particles is safe and helps visualize hypothetical next state
	 - energy tracking and logging helped catch subtle drift errors early
	 - trails + orbit overlays aid in visual debugging
