* 2025-06-22 - Newtonian Gravity

** Summaru
	 - refined newtonian gravity
	 - added verlet integration for higher simulation accuracy
	 -- fixes drift as well
	 - tuning constants::DT to 0.0069444 (1/144) / 4.0 - stable orbit
	 - fixed window area clipping, whole window is used now

** Observations
	 - need to use predicted positions (particles_next) with correct acceleration logic
	 - cloning particles is safe and helps visualize hypothetical next state
	 - energy tracking and logging helped catch subtle drift errors early
	 - trails + orbit overlays aid in visual debugging

** Next Steps
	 - modularize force logic (e.g. create `Force` trait)
	 - add massless and spring-linked particles
	 - implement proper unit handling or abstraction layer for scaled simulations
	 - begin field/grid planning for curvature simulation
