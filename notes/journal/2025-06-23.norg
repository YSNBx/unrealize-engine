* 2025-06-23 â€“ Force Abstraction & Stability

** summary
	 - added Force trait abstraction
	 - refactored Newtonian gravity into NewtonianGravity struct
	 - passed forces as Vec\<Box\<dyn Force>>, allowing modular plug-in
	 - introduced artificial "push" force to test multi-force integration
	 - verified integration stability with velocity Verlet and softening
	 - observed orbital disruption when layering non-gravitational force

** notes
	 - energy conservation diagnostics work well for debugging
	 - trait system enables seamless force layering without rewriting logic
