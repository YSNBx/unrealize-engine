* Unrealize Engine Design

** Purpose
	To simulate fundamental forces as modular code and identify mismatches to reverse-engineer

** Architecture Overview
	- (x) Simulation Core (main loop, time steps, delta updates)
	- (x) Entity System (particles, fields)
	- (x) Force Modules:
	-- (x) Gravity (Newtonian)
	-- ( ) Electromagnetism
	-- ( ) Quantum Field
	-- ( ) Entropy / Information
	- ( ) Spacetime Grid (2D to start)
	- (x) Logging + Visualization (print debug states, terminal + visual)

** Initial Goals
	- (x) Fixed timestep loop with `DT = 0.00694444 / 4.0`
	- (x) Newtonian gravity with softening and elastic collisions
	- (x) Position + velocity Verlet integration
	- (x) Multi-body gravitational simulation (Sun + planets)
	- (x) 2D pixel renderer with zoom/pan/click interaction
	- (x) Energy tracker (KE, PE, total)
	- (x) Trail rendering + orbit overlays
	- (x) Real-time energy drift logger
	- (x) Camera system with pause toggle and scale control

** Future Directions
	- (x) Trait-based modular force system
	- ( ) Plug-and-play entity groups (planets, particles, black holes)
	- ( ) Spacetime sampling grid
	- ( ) CSV + state snapshot system
	- ( ) Force field overlays (gravitational vector field?)
	- ( ) Visual editor (GUI or command-line)
