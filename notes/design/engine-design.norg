* Unrealize Engine Design

** Purpose
	 To simulate fundamental forces as modular code and identify mismatches to reverse-engineer

** Architecture Overview
	 - (x) Simulation Core (main loop, time steps, delta updates)
	 - ( ) Entity System (particles, fields)
	 - ( ) Force Modules:
	 -- ( ) Gravity
	 -- ( ) Electromagnetism
	 -- ( ) Quantum Field
	 -- ( ) Entropy / Information
	 - ( ) Spacetime Grid (2D to start)
	 - ( ) Logging + Visualization (print debug states, maybe term UI)

** Initial Goals
	 - (x) Build minimal engine loop with fixed time step
	 - (x) Implement Newtonian gravity module
	 - (x) Add two particles and simulate attraction
	 - (x) Print state per frame (position, velocity, acceleration, force)
