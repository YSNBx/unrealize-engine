* Newtonian Gravity Theory

** Overview
	 Newtonian gravity describes the attractive force between two masses.
	 It is a classical model that works well at low speeds and weak gravitational fields.

** Scalar Formula
	 F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2

	 Where:
	 - F = magnitude of force
	 - G = gravitational constant
	 - m1, m2 = masses of the two bodies
	 - r = distance between them

** Vector Form
	 To apply direction:
	 - r̂ = normalize(pos2 - pos1)
	 - F⃗ = r̂ * F

** Assumptions and Limitations
	 - Assumes instantaneous action at a distance
	 - Does not account for time dilation or curvature
	 - Breaks down near large masses or high speeds

** Use Case in Engine
	 This is the first force system to implement.
	 It allows verifying engine loop, force calculation, and basic motion.
