* Newtonian Gravity Theory

** Overview
	 Newtonian gravity describes the attractive force between two masses.
	 It is a classical model that works well at low speeds and weak gravitational fields.

** Gravitational Constant
	 G = 6.67430e-11 m³ * kg⁻¹ * s⁻²

** Scalar Formula
	 F = G * (m₁ * m₂) / r²

	 Where:
	 - F = scalar magnitude of gravitational force
	 - G = gravitational constant
	 - m₁, m₂ = masses of the two bodies
	 - r = distance between their centers

** Vector Form
	 To apply direction:
	 - r⃗ = pos₂ - pos₁ (displacement vector from A to B)
	 - r̂ = normalize(r⃗) (unit direction vector)
	 - F⃗ = r̂ * F

	 This yields the directional gravitational force vector between the two bodies.

** Energy in Newtonian Gravity
*** Kinetic Energy (KE)
		KE = ½ * m * v²  
		- Energy due to motion  
		- Tracked per particle

*** Potential Energy (PE)
		PE = -G * (m₁ * m₂) / r  
		- Gravitational potential between two particles  
		- Negative value reflects bound systems  
		- Summed over all unique particle pairs

*** Total Mechanical Energy
		E_total = ∑ KE + ∑ PE  
		- Should be conserved in an isolated system  
		- Useful for debugging force accuracy and integration drift

** Collision Handling in Simulation
	 - Particles are given a radius to simulate size
	 - When particles overlap (distance < sum of radii), a collision response is triggered
	 - Elastic collisions are resolved using momentum-conserving velocity exchange

*** Velocity Projection (Dot Product)
		- For elastic collision, velocity is projected onto the collision axis:
		v₁ₙ = v₁ · n̂  
		v₂ₙ = v₂ · n̂  
		(where n̂ is the unit vector between particle centers)

		- These scalar projections represent how much velocity is aligned with the impact
		- Resulting normal velocities are exchanged based on mass to conserve momentum

** Assumptions and Limitations
	 - Assumes instantaneous action at a distance (no delay)
	 - Ignores relativistic effects (curved spacetime, time dilation)
	 - Breaks down in strong gravity fields or at high velocities

** Use Case in Unrealize Engine
	 - First force module to implement
	 - Validates simulation loop and vector math
	 - Simple baseline for comparing future models (relativistic, quantum, etc.)
